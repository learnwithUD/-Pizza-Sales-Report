# Pizza-Sales-Report

# Introduction
For a company to continually experience growth in sales, its sales report must be analysed over a period to identity its strengths and weaknesses. This project was aimed to assess performance, sales trends, forecasting, and total revenue made via pizza sales in 2015 using its key factors.
Insights were also derived from below business questions;

• What are the best and worst selling pizzas?

• What is the peak time for pizza sale?

• What is the percentage distribution of pizza sales across the day?

• What was the total revenue generated in the year 2015?

• Which day of the week was the busiest?

• Which month had the most sales and what was the quantity?

• What size of pizza sold most?

• Are there pizza that should be taken off the menu or use as specials?

# Conclusion and Recommendation

• Most pizza were ordered during the lunch period.

• The peak of the week is Friday as people preferred to eat pizza towards the weekend.

• Having thyme as part of its ingredient is the major factor the brie carre pizza performed poorly in sales as no other pizza had thyme as part of its ingredients.

• The xl and xxl size need to be removed from the menu as both quantity ordered and sales did very poor.

• Promotional campaign should be organised on Sundays to boost its sales as it’s the least sales day.

• Discount should be offered on low order and sales pizzas.

• Alternative for thyme should be explored to revive the brie carre pizza sales.

• There should be more staff on duty during the peak time, day and month to ensure prompt delivery and efficient service

• More pizza needs to be introduce in the large size as this is the most preferred size.
